<!-- 
The 6th Workshop on Responsible Recommendation (FAccTRec 2023) was held in conjunction with the 17th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems on September, 2023 at Singapore, in a hybrid format. This workshop brought together researchers and practitioners to discuss several topics under the banner of social responsibility in recommender systems: fairness, accountability, transparency, privacy, and other ethical and social concerns. It served to advance research and discussion of these topics in the recommender systems space, and incubate ideas for future development and refinement. -->
