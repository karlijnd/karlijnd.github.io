<!-- 
Streaming services have become one of today’s main sources of music consumption, with music recommender systems (MRS) as important components. The MRS’ choices strongly influence what users consume, and vice versa [3]. Therefore, there is a growing interest in ensuring the fairness of these choices for all stakeholders involved. Firstly, for users, unfairness might result in some users receiving lower-quality recommendations in terms of accuracy and coverage [4]. Secondly, item provider (i.e. artist) unfairness might result in some artists receiving less exposure, and therefore less revenue [2]. However, it is challenging to improve fairness without a decrease in, for instance, overall recommendation quality or user satisfaction. Additional complications arise when balancing possibly domain-specific objectives for multiple stakeholders at once [2]. While fairness research exists from both the user and artist perspective in the music domain, there is a lack of research directly consulting artists—with [3] as an exception.
When interacting with recommendation systems and evaluating their fairness, the many factors influencing recommendation system decisions can cause another difficulty: lack of transparency [5]. Artists indicate they would appreciate more transparency in MRS—both towards the user and themselves [3]. While e.g. [5] use explanations to increase  transparency for MRS users, to the best of our knowledge, no research has addressed improving transparency for artists this way.
This interdisciplinary research project aims to bridge the gap between MRS and item providers. To improve fairness and transparency for artists, our goal is to answer these questions:
* RQ1: What do artists consider to be the main improvement areas in streaming services, and in automated music recommendations in particular?
* RQ2: How could MRS explanations best serve artists?
* RQ3: How should explanations for artists be implemented in a music recommendation ecosystem?
To answer RQ1, we further establish the artists’ perspective on MRS through conducting interviews. Building on [3], who interviewed Spanish-speaking artists, we ask Dutch-speaking artists about how they feel affected by current MRS implementations, and potential fairness improvements there. As both the Spanish and Dutch participant samples contain a diverse set of artists (e.g., in genre, popularity, age and gender), we expect to gain additional insight into MRS fairness perspectives through these interviews. Moreover, we will be able to identify cultural differences, if any.
Since the interviews suggest transparency as a main improvement area, we further address this in RQ2 and study how MRS explanations could contribute to item provider fairness. We apply findings from user-centered studies that utilize different user characteristics, e.g. [5], and from other domains that focus on item provider or multi-stakeholder explanations, such as [1].
Based on RQ2 conclusions, to answer RQ3 we develop MRS explanations for artists with particular attention to robustness. We balance added transparency with added cognitive load, and focus especially on fairness-clarifying or enhancing techniques.
This work will provide valuable insights into artists’ perspectives on fairness, and a novel application of MRS explanations. We will lay the foundation for positive impact on MRS transparency for artists, as well as for developers aiming to improve fairness. -->
